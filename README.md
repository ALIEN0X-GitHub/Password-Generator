# Password-Generator
This code implements a password generator in Python.

```python pass_gen.py```

This Python code helps you create strong passwords easily. It asks you how long you want your password to be and what types of characters you want to include, like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Then, it generates a random password for you based on your preferences and shows it to you.
